				<h2>Welcome to the site</h2>
				<p>life with a disability can be challenging for both the person 
				that has the disability and the family of the person. The purpose I 
				have in creating the content for this site is to be an information 
				source for people that are newly injured, there family members, or  
				possibly someone that has had a life long disability like myself. 
				This site will hopefully provide information on something you are 
				interested in, if you are interested or in involved in something that
				is not covered on this site please contact me about including the 
				the information on this site. The advice that I will provide will be 
				based off of my experience I cannot tell you what would work for you, 
				that decision rests only with <strong>you.</strong></p>
					
				<p>My story is that I have had a disability all my life. I have played
				some type of wheelchair sport ever since the age of 5. I have not let 
				the condition I have define who I am. I competed on high school teams
				like any teen that participates in sports would do. It was also at this
				time that I thought my athletic career would end. However, in my junior
				year I found out about the National Wheelchair Basketball Association
				this is a league of wheelchair basketball teams from across the country.
				Competing in this league I have been to national tournaments and been 
				coached by 2 hall of fame players. I have also worked for a professional
				sports Mixed Martial Arts promotion which allowed me to travel and do 
				things I never thought I would have done. in the past few years I have 
				started playing wheelchair rugby.</p>
